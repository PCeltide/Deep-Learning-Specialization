### Coursera - DeepLearning.AI

## Course Overview

This repository archives my solutions for the programming assignments in the **[Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)** by Andrew Ng, offered through Coursera. The five-course program provides a comprehensive foundation in deep learning, covering concepts from foundational neural networks to advanced applications in computer vision and natural language processing.

This repository contains my implementations of the various models and techniques taught throughout the specialization.

## Assignments Overview
